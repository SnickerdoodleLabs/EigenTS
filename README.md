# EigenTS

A minimalist typescript interface for the [Eigen Tux](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) matrix library (calculation run in [WASM](https://webassembly.org/)). Perform fast matrix-matrix multiplies, norm calculations, and system solves (Ax=b) in a mobile or desktop browser. 

Currently, this demo focuses on dense matrix operations, but could easily be extended to include sparse matrix methods as well.
